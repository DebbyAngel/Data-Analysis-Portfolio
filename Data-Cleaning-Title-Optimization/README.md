# Data Cleaning & Title Optimization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and optimizing product title data to enhance readability and standardization. 
The goal was to remove inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates while generating a meaningful 
Short_title feature for improved product identification.

## Problem Statement
The raw dataset contained various data quality issues, including:
- Missing values in key columns
- Duplicate product entries
- Inconsistent text formatting (extra spaces, special characters, unstructured titles)
- Lengthy product titles with unnecessary brand names and repetitive descriptors

## Dataset
- Raw Data: Copy of productdataD.xlsx
- Cleaned Data: Cleaned_Product_Dataset.csv
- Total Entries Before Cleaning: 3,719
- Total Entries After Cleaning: 3,469

## Data Cleaning Steps
1. Handled Missing Values: Automated Short_title generation filled gaps where necessary.
2. Removed Duplicates: Identified and eliminated 178 duplicate records.
3. Standardized Formats: Removed extra spaces, special characters, and formatted text uniformly.
4. Title Optimization: Extracted essential keywords while preserving product attributes to 
   generate a more readable and concise Short_title feature.

## Key Insights
- Reduced data redundancy by removing 178 duplicate entries.
- Ensured complete product descriptions by filling missing values.
- Optimized product titles, making them more user-friendly for searching and categorization.

## Final Recommendations
- Implement automated title optimization in future data entries to maintain consistency.
- Regularly audit product listings for missing values and duplicate records.
- Establish formatting guidelines to improve data uniformity.

## Conclusion
The data cleaning and title optimization process significantly improved the dataset’s quality. Key achievements include:

- Eliminating duplicates: Reduced the dataset from 3,719 to 3,469 unique entries, ensuring data integrity.
- Handling missing values: Applied automated title optimization to fill gaps, improving completeness.
- Standardizing formats: Removed inconsistencies, extra spaces, and special characters for uniformity.
- Optimizing product titles: Created a Short_title feature that enhanced readability while preserving key product attributes.
- Improving data usability: The cleaned dataset is now structured for better analysis, searchability, 
  and categorization.

These improvements increase the dataset’s reliability and usability, making it more effective for business 
insights and decision-making. Future recommendations include automating title optimization further and 
implementing data validation rules to maintain consistency.
