# Data Cleaning & Title Optimization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and optimizing product title data to enhance readability and standardization. The goal was to remove inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates while generating a concise **Short_title** feature for improved product identification.

## Problem Statement
The raw dataset contained several data quality issues:
- Missing values in key columns  
- Duplicate product entries  
- Inconsistent text formatting (extra spaces, special characters)  
- Lengthy product titles with unnecessary brand names and repetitive descriptors  

## Dataset & Files (Hosted on Google Drive)
All files for this project—raw dataset, cleaned dataset, and the final technical report—are located in the following Google Drive folder:

Inside that folder, you'll find:
- **Product_Dataset.xlsx** (Raw dataset)  
- **Cleaned_Product_Dataset.csv** (Cleaned dataset)  
- **Debby_Technical_Report.pdf** (Technical report)

## Data Cleaning Steps
1. **Handled Missing Values:** Automated Short_title generation filled gaps where necessary.  
2. **Removed Duplicates:** Identified and eliminated 178 duplicate records.  
3. **Standardized Formats:** Removed extra spaces, special characters, and enforced uniform text formatting.  
4. **Title Optimization:** Extracted essential keywords while preserving product attributes to generate a concise **Short_title** feature.

## Key Insights
- **Reduced data redundancy** by removing 178 duplicate entries.  
- **Ensured completeness** by filling missing values.  
- **Optimized product titles**, making them more user-friendly for search and categorization.

## Final Recommendations
- **Implement automated title optimization** in future data entries to maintain consistency.  
- **Regularly audit** product listings for missing values and duplicate records.  
- **Establish formatting guidelines** to improve data uniformity.

## Conclusion
The **data cleaning and title optimization** process significantly improved the dataset’s quality. Key achievements include:

- **Eliminating duplicates:** Reduced from 3,719 to 3,469 unique entries, ensuring data integrity.  
- **Handling missing values:** Automated title optimization filled gaps, improving completeness.  
- **Standardizing formats:** Removed inconsistencies, extra spaces, and special characters for uniformity.  
- **Optimizing product titles:** Created a **Short_title** feature that enhanced readability while preserving key product attributes.  
- **Improving data usability:** The cleaned dataset is now structured for better analysis, searchability, and categorization.

These improvements increase the dataset’s **reliability and usability**, making it more effective for business insights and decision-making. Future recommendations include **further automation** of the title optimization process and implementing **data validation rules** to maintain consistency.
